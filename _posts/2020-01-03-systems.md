What number is that? Is it special? Is it a prime? Is it the answer to life, the universe and everything? Is it the number of salsa jars I have? Not really, it’s just a number I got when I randomly smashed my keyboard and removed the letters and symbols. (Spoilers: It isn’t prime, but the closest is 8 numbers away so not too bad) But one thing about that number is that it’s big. Big big. You wouldn’t want to mess with it in any way, right? 

But if it was small, would you?

### <ins> <strong> Baby Steps </strong> </ins>
First, let’s go back to when YOU were small. Like baby small. Back then, your brain wasn’t wired up for Math at all, nor for anything at that time. But slowly you learnt stuff; you learnt to speak, you learnt to spell, you even learnt how to use the bathroom. But another thing you learnt was how to count. Imagine you have some apples in front of you (how many isn’t important). You probably would have ‘counted’ them by giving them names, like how you gave your parents name like ‘mum’ and ‘dad’. So maybe you counted them like ‘Ogee, Gahoo, Gayo, Heehaa, Pllbt’ and so on. You assigned names to the apples. While doing so you may have assigned each of them to a finger of yours, so Ogee was your right thumb, Gahoo your right index and so on. But when you reached your last 10th finger, what did you do? You would have closed your hands and start again from your right thumb, then right index and so forth (The special of us would have continued with their toes, but I assume their gymnasts now). This is what is called our counting system, the base-10 number system, where we ‘restart’ whenever we hit the last 10th digit (1,2,3,...,9,0) to form bigger numbers.

But sometimes the number gets too big, like our randomly-created one at the start. Surely there’s a way to make it smaller, right? Surely there is a way that messy thing could become neater, right? And yes it can, in different bases. With different number bases besides our classic base-10, we can create two kinds of benefits: Big numbers turning into smaller numbers, or messy numbers into neat numbers (why they both mostly can’t coexist will be explained later).



### <ins> <strong> Understanding the Powers Within </strong> </ins>
But first, let’s understand how number-based systems work by looking at our base-10 counting system. Each digit place corresponds to a power of the base (Welcome back indices!). The digit in those places tells you how many of each base-power number there are. The first digit place is the 1s or the (100)s place. So 6 would be 6 1s or just simply 6. The second digit place is the 10s or the (101)s place. So 26 would correspond to 2 10s and 6 1s so 2(10)+6(1)=26 and so forth for the other digits. For all bases, the value at the nth digit place is the base number powered (n-1). It can be seen that in different bases the digit place will play a different role according to the base number.

Now we can look at the different kinds of bases we normally use, both in Maths and in real life. (I will only tackle the basic elements of number bases because the calculation aspects are very confusing and may probably burn your brains out. You’re welcome.)

### <ins> <strong> 1 + 1 = 10 </strong> </ins>
To turn messy numbers into neat ones, we take a look at a classic number system, the base-2 number system, better known as the binary system. Binary is a very easy number system to master because it only uses 2 digits in all its numbers: 0 and 1. This is particularly handy in the field of computer science, as switches or transistors are used in every circuit built by engineers. So a binary system helps show the on and off state of the switches clearly, 1 for on and 0 for off. Binary exists, at least in our modern world today, everywhere around us. The moving pictures on your TV screen? Just a bunch of 1s and 0s turning on and off as the scene moves. You using fingerprint recognition on your phone? Just your phone detecting whether your print matches the 1s and 0s of the copy it stores on your phone. (Fun fact: The word bits, or ⅛th of a byte, is the shortened form of Binary Digits.) However, as we will later see why, memory space is done by the base-16, base-32 and base-64 number systems.

Similar to base-10, the digit places of binary corresponds to powers of 2. So the first place is the 1s, second place is 2s, third place 4s, 8s, 16s etc. So 2 in base-10 corresponds to 10 in binary, 10 in base-10 is 1010 in binary and so on. So for our base-10 number 298,767,323, it will correspond to 10001 11001110 11010011 11011011 in binary (Just like how in base-10 we put commas after every 3 digits for easier comprehension, binary numbers usually have a spacing every 8 digits for that same reason). That sure is bigger than the original! But look at how simple it is!! Just be careful where you put the 1s and 0s in between. 

(Note: We can equate both the numbers as equal in different bases. We just have to note down for each number the base it is in. For this, the common notation is $a_n$, where a is the number representation in base-n.)

To convert from base-10 to binary by yourself is easy, as long as you can remember your powers of 2. Say you have the number 4325. First, find the biggest power of 2 that can be minus off completely from 4325. In this case, it’s $2^{12}$ or 4096. So the 13th digit (from the right) is a 1. 4325-4096=229 so the next highest power is $2^7$ or 128, so the 8th digit is a 1, while the digits between it and the 13th digit are all 0s. Continue from 229-128=101 to get $2^6$ or 64, 101-64=37 where it’s $2^5$ or 32 and so forth until you get your final answer of 1000011100101. (You could, of course, do this in a calculator like the Casio fx-96SG PLUS, but where’s the fun in that?)

However, a subtle flaw can be seen in this system, as well as any base system below our normal base-10; The numbers grow very big, very fast. 

As seen by our examples above, the binary system produces numbers that can be way bigger than their counterparts in base-10. Even the number 2 is turned into 10 in binary, 5 times the number in base-10! So while it is conveniently good as it uses only 2 digits for its numbers, it is not spacially good as it churns out big numbers that take up too much space, a problem faced in computing. Imagine your one meme taking up all the space in your phone’s storage. Now that would be scary. 

The good thing is computers and electronics have a magic number: 256. That corresponds to 100000000 in binary. That is the limit of binary as memory space, otherwise known as a byte, so the max number a device can store is 255 or 11111111 in binary. So what can be done for bigger numbers? Well, we can compress the numbers and save space, thanks to hexadecimal (Base-16), Base32 and ASCII Base64.

### <ins> <strong> It's a Big World Down There </strong> </ins>
Ever wonder how way back then, a floppy disk could only store 1MB of data, but now a micro-SD card the size of your fingertip can store up to even 1TB?! That is a lot of space. But how is it done? It’s all with the help of big bases, especially 16, 32 and 64. (Well, also the fact that microprocessors are becoming smaller and smaller, but that’s another thing.)

But hold on, you say. We only have ten digits. How are we going to use, say base-16 (otherwise known as hexadecimal), with only 10? Well, after the digit 9, our good friend English comes by to help by donating its capital letters to numbers. So A will represent 10, B is 11, C is 12 etc. This helps make numbers much smaller, and it grows much slower than binary as well since each digit place can hold up to 16 ‘digits’. The first digit place in hexadecimal can also hold up to 2 bytes, so at base-16 it’s already crunching the binary numbers. So for our 298,767,323, it’s 11CED3DB in hexadecimal.

Such a nice small number! Better than the 13-digit binary number from earlier. Of course, the flaw in this is that more characters are being used, meaning more confusion for the common people. But in the world today, memory space is much more sacred than having simplicity. You would prefer to save your projects in one thumb drive rather than one small project separated into 50 thumb drives, wouldn’t you?

But yet I hear you cry again: But we only have 26 letters. So what happens for Base32 and Base64? Well, after capital letters, lowercase letters and the symbols on your keyboard are used. But for Base32 and Base64 the orders are different. 

For Base32, A is 0, B is 1, C is 2 and so on until Z which is 25. After that, the value of 26 is given to 2 (0 and 1 are skipped because of their similarities with O and I), 3 is 27 etc. until 7 for 31 (Yes, confusing I know. It’s best to leave the practical parts to the computing professionals). So 298,767,323 is 8STKUR in Base32. Barely any recognisable numbers left!

Base64 is similar, except the values of 26 to 51 are given to the lowercase letters a to z. From 52 to 61 are our old friends 0 to 9, and 62 and 63 are + and / respectively. So once again our number 298,767,323 turns into RztPb in base 64. A word that can probably be pronounced best by babies.

But of course, as you can see, It is quite difficult to remember what symbol represents what in a big base, even more so when you are converting the numbers to and fro. I’m sure half the time you don’t even know which symbols represent what. The ancient Babylonians even used a base-60 counting system, and they only had clay tablets to note the numbers down on, so it would be hard for them to differentiate whether the 1 symbol alone meant 1 or 60.

In conclusion, base systems bring about pros and cons: It can be short but full of variety, or long but with only a few used digits. Regardless, the number systems provide us with the insight that, like spoken and written language on Earth, Math is a multi-universal way of communicating, be it through calculations or equations. Our base-10 number system isn’t the only one we can use to count, nor is it the only one anyone in the universe may be using. We could have a neighbouring alien civilisation whose people only have two ‘fingers’, thus they would use the binary way of counting. If calculations are done differently somewhere else, it could actually be what we are also doing, just in another form, and so we can learn to convert from one form to another. And as always, thanks for reading.
